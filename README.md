## General info
This app is a one-player game of Tic-Tac-Toe, played against the computer.  The computer uses the Min-Max Algorithm to determine it's next move.  In keeping with how this game is typically played in real-world senarios, the initial move is assigned randomly to either the player or the computer.  The 'X' and 'O' delimiters are also randomly assigned.  The app tracks the score, though it can be safely ignored - as it is in most real-world senarios.

This project was written for the following reasons:
* Demonstrate my ability to...
  * ...use the React framework.
  * ...integrate type-checking in React applications.
  * ...integrate Node, eslint, and Webpack into my React projects.
  * ...implement recursive algorithms.

* Give myself the opportunity to...
  * ...construct a build scaffold to stream-line production of future React projects.
  * ...learn and implement best-practices in my code.
  * ...keep myself up-to-date on skills that have already been acquired (Node, Webpack, eslint, SCSS, etc).
